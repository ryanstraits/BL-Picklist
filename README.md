# BL-Picklist

A phone/tablet-friendly pick-list app for open BrickLink orders. Netlify
Functions hold the BrickLink Store API credentials and sign every request
with OAuth 1.0a; the static frontend never sees them.

```
public/index.html                     → the app (order list → checklist)
netlify/functions/orders.js           → GET /api/orders
netlify/functions/order-items.js      → GET /api/orders/:id/items (flattened)
netlify/functions/colors.js           → GET /api/colors (cached)
netlify/functions/item-image.js       → GET /api/item-image?type=&no= (proxied photo)
netlify/functions/lib/bricklink.js    → shared OAuth1.0a request helper
```

## Setup

1. Register a consumer + access token at
   [bricklink.com/v2/api/register_consumer.page](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/api/register_consumer.page).
   Register the token against IP **`0.0.0.0`** — Netlify Functions don't
   have a fixed outbound IP, and BrickLink supports `0.0.0.0` as a wildcard
   for cloud-hosted apps.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the four values:
   ```
   BL_CONSUMER_KEY=
   BL_CONSUMER_SECRET=
   BL_TOKEN=
   BL_TOKEN_SECRET=
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Run locally with the Netlify CLI (loads `.env` automatically):
   ```
   npx netlify dev
   ```
   This serves `public/` and proxies `/api/*` to the functions.

## Deploy

Push to Netlify (via `netlify deploy` or a connected Git repo) and set the
same four `BL_*` variables as environment variables in the Netlify site
settings — **not** in the repo. Because the access token is registered
against the permissive `0.0.0.0` wildcard, treat the Consumer Secret and
Token Secret as sensitive as an API key that can move money.

## Notes

- `/api/orders` calls BrickLink with `direction=in` (orders where you're
  the seller) and returns every order status except `COMPLETED` by
  default. Override with `/api/orders?status=paid,packed` etc. if you want
  a narrower set. Order cards and the detail view show a color-coded
  status badge (fresh/paid, packed, shipped/received, cancelled/problem).
- `/api/item-image?type=&no=&color=&nu=` fetches up to three independent
  BrickLink photo sources concurrently — the official Catalog API's
  `image_url`, the color-specific catalog photo
  (`img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/{TYPE}{N|U}/{color_id}/{no}.png`), and
  BrickLink's own "large" size variant (`www.bricklink.com/{TYPE}L/{no}.jpg`,
  the same one linked from BrickLink's own item pages) — and uses
  whichever comes back with the most bytes, since which source actually
  has the most detail varies by item. Falls back to a small generic photo
  (`img.bricklink.com/{TYPE}/{no}.jpg`, no color variants) only if all
  three fail. BrickLink's hotlink protection blocks these when a browser
  requests them directly as an `<img>` subresource (even with no
  `Referer` sent — it appears to key off `Sec-Fetch-*` request metadata,
  which can't be suppressed client-side), so this function fetches
  server-side and streams the bytes back under our own origin. The
  response carries `X-Image-Tier` and `X-Image-Bytes` headers; the
  lightbox fetches via JS (rather than a plain `<img src>`, which can't
  read headers) to show which source and size it got. Each `<img>` falls
  back to a placeholder icon on load failure; tapping a photo opens it
  full-size in an in-page lightbox with pinch/pan/double-tap zoom (built
  on Touch Events, not the browser's native pinch-zoom, which is
  disabled site-wide to avoid accidental zooming while picking).
- Colors are fetched once from `/api/colors` and cached indefinitely in
  `localStorage`, since BrickLink color IDs essentially never change.
- "Picked" state is stored per-order in `localStorage` on the device —
  it doesn't sync across phone/iPad. See the spec for a Netlify Blobs-based
  sync option if that's wanted later.
- There's no auto-refresh; tap "Refresh" in the header to re-pull orders,
  which keeps usage well under BrickLink's 5,000 requests/day limit.
